			River North
			</h2>

				<p></p>
					I've lived in River North since March 2017. I moved here for the onvenience of being able to walk to work and the gym. Living in River North is busier than where I was living before in Nobel Square. But I like how much more there is within a 5 min walk.

					My Favorite Neighborhood Sights

						These are all places I frequently visit, but they all offer something different. East Bank I love to work out at. Three Greens has a great burger and a good place to hang out. They always seem to be playing great movies. And I love the rotating cocktail list at Broken Shaker. The ambiance is also wonderful. I feel like I'm at a 70s beach house.
